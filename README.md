# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

See images in the wiki for how the responsive site should look when running correctly

### `npm run deploy`

Deploys via GitHub Actions


## What you'll need

- An API key from footystats.org
- A proxy url to avoid CORS issues (see - https://nordicapis.com/10-free-to-use-cors-proxies/). Currently, a temporary cors-anywhere proxy server is in place, but this is slow
